## Usage

Example files can be found in the examples folder.  
Each year should have a different markdown file, with the YYYY.md format. The .md files have to be written in the following way:

```markdown
#Book Name/Book Author
[tag1,tag2,tag3,...,tagn]

* Quote 1.
  Here you can write your quote.
  You can use more than one line per quote, a new quote only begins with "*"
* Quote 2. You can write as many quotes as you want.
```

Book tags are optional.  
To mark a book as favorite, write an * at the end of the title line.

```markdown
#Favorite Book Name/Book Author*
```

If a book has multiple authors, use & to separate them.

```markdown
#Book Name/Author 1 & Author 2
```
